CuHatching
CuHatching is an accelerator program happening at Carleton University to help software and business students learn about being entrepreneurs. We were given just over two hours to create a business idea and plan related to student learning. In this time, we created an idea to help students learn, a business plan and website. This github repo is for the website.
